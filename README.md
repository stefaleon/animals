# animals
* React Native with Redux mini app
* Remake of the tech-stack app, displaying a list of animals instead of tech-libraries
* Part of [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/)

### Node, NPM, Yarn, react-native, redux, react-redux


&nbsp;
## 00 Initial commit

* Initialize a new project with the react-native cli.

```
$ react-native init animals
```




&nbsp;
## 01 Basic boilerplate

* Install Redux and react-redux

```
$  npm install --save redux react-redux

```

* Create the src folder, move App.js in it and edit index.js in order to find the new location of App.js.

*./index.js*

```
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './src/App';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('manager', () => App);
```
* Create the reducers folder inside src. Create index.js inside reducers and inside combineReducers add the animalsReducer that returns an empty list.

*./src/reducers/index.js*

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

export default combineReducers({
  animalsReducer: () => []
});
```

* Remove the default content out of App.js and replace it with the following basic boilerplate code for a react native with redux app.

*./src/App.js*
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text,  View } from 'react-native';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import reducers from './reducers';

export default class App extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={createStore(reducers)} >
        <View>
          <Text>
              Animals - React Native with Redux 
          </Text>
        </View>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}
```


* An error such as

```
You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components:
[Android SDK Build-Tools 23.0.1].
```

might occure due to the absence of the *./android/local.properties* file.
This file should have been autogenerated by android.
If it is not present, add it and fill in the location of the SDK folder, something like

```
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_ACCOUNT\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```
