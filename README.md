# animals
* React Native with Redux mini app
* Remake of the tech-stack app, displaying a list of animals instead of tech-libraries
* Part of [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/)
by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider)

### Node, NPM, Yarn, react-native, redux, react-redux


&nbsp;
## 00 Initial commit

* Initialize a new project with the react-native cli.

```
$ react-native init animals
```




&nbsp;
## 01 Basic boilerplate

* Install Redux and react-redux

```
$  npm install --save redux react-redux

```

* Create the src folder, move App.js in it and edit index.js in order to find the new location of App.js.

*./index.js*

```
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './src/App';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('manager', () => App);
```
* Create the reducers folder inside src. Create index.js inside reducers and inside combineReducers add the animalsReducer that returns an empty list.

*./src/reducers/index.js*

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

export default combineReducers({
  animalsReducer: () => []
});
```

* Remove the default content out of App.js and replace it with the following basic boilerplate code for a react native with redux app.

*./src/App.js*
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text,  View } from 'react-native';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import reducers from './reducers';

export default class App extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={createStore(reducers)} >
        <View>
          <Text>
              Animals - React Native with Redux
          </Text>
        </View>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}
```


* An error such as

```
You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components:
[Android SDK Build-Tools 23.0.1].
```

might occure due to the absence of the *./android/local.properties* file.
This file should have been autogenerated by android.
If it is not present, add it and fill in the location of the SDK folder, something like

```
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_ACCOUNT\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```



&nbsp;
## 03 Header and AnimalReducer

* Get a copy of the *./Components/common* folder from the [*auth*](https://github.com/stefaleon/Authentication-with-React-Native) app.

* Import *Header* and use it in App.js.

```
import { Header } from './components/common';
```

```  
    <Header headerText="Animals" />
```

* Add some animal data. In *./src/reducers* create *animals.json* which will contain the animals' data as a JSON object. Source: [San Diego Zoo](http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals)

* In *./src/reducers* create *AnimalReducer.js*. It will be returning the list of animals. Import and export the data from './animals.json'.

```
import data from './animals.json';

export default () => data;
```


* Wire AnimalReducer up in *./src/reducers/index.js*. The animals property of the combineReducers, gets the state from AnimalReducer.

```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import AnimalReducer from './AnimalReducer';

export default combineReducers({
  animals: AnimalReducer
});
```
